				<h3>Music is everybody's possession</h3>
				<h4>May 17 2022</h4>
				<p>The Score gained recognition when the British supermarket chain Asda (owned by Walmart) used their single "Oh My Love" in a major advertising campaign titled "Save Money, Live Better". According to Asda, part of the reason why they selected the song was because "they were unsigned and unknown". The song's placement in the advertisement helped The Score rise in the public eye, and "Oh My Love" reached number 43 on the UK Singles Chart in July 2015. That same year, the track became the most-detected song from an advertisement by the Shazam music identification service. The song also appeared in the 2015 film Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. The Score released a single, Catching Fire, shortly after the release of Oh My Love. Following the success of "Oh My Love", The Score signed a record deal with Republic Records. They released their extended play, Where Do You Run, in September 2015. The Score released their cover of Post Malone's song, White Iverson, shortly after.</p>
